This is a 3D graphics demo I wrote in high school (circa 1997).

Source code
-----------
The main program is in [src/3D6.PAS](src/3D6.PAS).

Running the demo
----------------
The [vbox](vbox) directory contains a [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) VM that can be used to run the program. Type "3D6" to start. The program will print some memory information; press the enter key to continue. Use the numeric keypad or arrow keys to move around. Press "7" to look up and "1" to look down. Press "esc" to exit.
